# Discussions on Containers

I see, docker, docker-compose, docker swarm, kubernetes. And the open source docker (OCI).

Idk whats the "best" idea of doing this. But I kinda just want to give the user a single choice or maybe 2 choices. And configure one of them enough for their needs.

Docker swarm is apparently quite simple to use and setup. But no real point using it over kubernetes.

I want things as automated as possible.

## Philosophy

Principle of least privilege.

Security, privacy, only going to become more important as time goes on.
-> focuses on securing the container from other things around it

Latency over performance. User centric.

Speed is a thing, but simplicitly is too. You want your product to be easily setup and get going. But with a wide arrange of configuration options for extra optimisation. Low floor, high ceiling.
-> automation, easier config UI, etc
